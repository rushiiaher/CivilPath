Drawing Elements:
- Circles = Processes (numbered 1.0, 2.0, etc.)
- Rectangles = External Entities
- Open Rectangles = Data Stores (D1, D2, D3)
- Arrows = Data Flows with descriptive labels
```

**Detailed Process Descriptions:**

1. **Process 1.0 - User Authentication**:
   - Input: Login credentials from Student
   - Output: JWT Token for access
   - Function: Validates user and provides access rights

2. **Process 2.0 - Admin Authentication**:
   - Input: Admin credentials
   - Output: Admin JWT Token
   - Function: Validates admin user for content management

3. **Process 3.0 - Content Retrieval**:
   - Input: Content requests from authenticated users
   - Output: Exam data, resources, blog content
   - Data Stores: Reads from D1, D2, D3

4. **Process 4.0 - Content Management**:
   - Input: Content updates from Admin
   - Output: Updated content in databases
   - Data Stores: Writes to D1, D2, D3

5. **Process 5.0 - Resource Delivery**:
   - Input: Resource requests
   - Output: Download links and file access
   - Function: Manages file delivery and download tracking

6. **Process 6.0 - Syllabus Management**:
   - Input: Syllabus documents and exam mapping
   - Output: Organized syllabus structure
   - Data Stores: Updates D1 (Exams) and D2 (Resources)

**Data Store Descriptions:**
- **D1 - Exams Database**: Stores exam information, stages, subjects
- **D2 - Resources Database**: Stores study materials, files, metadata
- **D3 - Blog Database**: Stores blog posts, articles, educational content

**Drawing Tips:**
1. Use circles for processes, rectangles for entities, open rectangles for data stores
2. Number processes sequentially (1.0, 2.0, etc.)
3. Label all data flows with descriptive names
4. Keep arrows straight and avoid crossing lines where possible
5. Group related processes together
6. Use consistent spacing and alignment
7. Add process names inside circles
8. Show data flow direction clearly with arrow heads

**Key Data Flow Patterns:**
- Student → Authentication → Resource Access → Download
- Admin → Authentication → Content Management → Database Updates
- Database → Content Retrieval → Student Interface
- File Uploads → Validation → Processing → Storage → Delivery
- Search Requests → Query Processing → Results → Display
