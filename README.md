# CivilPath Study Platform - Mini Project Report

## Title of the Project
**CivilPath Study Platform: A Comprehensive Web-Based Learning Management System for Civil Services Examination Preparation**

## Abstract

The CivilPath Study Platform is a modern web-based learning management system designed specifically for civil services examination preparation. The platform provides a centralized hub for students preparing for various competitive exams like UPSC, MPSC, and other state-level civil services examinations. 

The system features a dual-interface architecture with a public-facing student portal and an administrative panel for content management. Students can access exam-specific resources, syllabus materials, study notes, previous year papers, and educational blog content. Administrators can manage exam structures, upload resources, create blog posts, and maintain syllabus information through a secure admin interface.

Built using modern web technologies including React.js for the frontend, Node.js for the backend API, and MongoDB for data storage, the platform ensures scalability, security, and optimal user experience. The system implements JWT-based authentication, role-based access control, and responsive design principles to deliver a comprehensive educational solution.

## Introduction

2. **Secondary Objectives**:
   - Implement secure admin panel for content management
   - Provide exam-specific resource organization
   - Enable blog-based knowledge sharing
   - Ensure responsive and user-friendly interface
   - Implement scalable database architecture

### Scope
- Multi-exam support (UPSC, MPSC, State Services)
- Resource management (PDFs, study materials, previous papers)
- Blog system for educational content
- Admin panel for complete system management
- Responsive web design for all devices
